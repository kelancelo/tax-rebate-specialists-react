                                        <strong>INDEMNIFICATION</strong>. Affiliate shall indemnify,

                                        affiliates, and their respec- tive officers, directors,

                                        fees and related costs, in any way arising out of Affiliate’s or

                                        regulation; breach of any warranty hereunder; or provision of

                                        of Affiliate. Tax Rebate Specialists shall provide Affiliate
                                        with prompt notice of any claim and also cooperate in all
                                        reasonable respects with Affiliate, its insurance company, and
                                        its legal counsel in its defense of such claim at Affiliate’s
                                        sole expense. Affiliate may not settle any potential suit
                                        hereunder without Tax Rebate Specialists’ prior written
                                        approval. If Affiliate fails to promptly indemnify and defend a
                                        covered claim, TRS shall have the right to defend itself, and in
                                        such case, Affiliate shall promptly reimburse Tax Rebate
                                        Specialists for all of TRS’ associated costs and expenses.

                                        Agreement is invalid or unen- forceable, but that by limiting
                                        such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such

                                        as so limited.
